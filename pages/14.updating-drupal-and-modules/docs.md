! When you plan to perform an update, please follow the Drupal's documentation on how to update the [core](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/update) and [modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/update/update-modules). You should consider that sometimes updates may break your website or some of its functionalities. A reason for this can be a bug in a module, conflict with some other modules or core, missing dependency or incompatibility with your environment. Breaking your site or functionalities with updates or with installing new modules **IS NOT AN ITEM ISSUE NOR A THEME ISSUE** and is not covered by the [ThemeForest support policy](https://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy). 

If you find yourself in a situation like this from above, try to google the error thrown by your site or go to the module's [issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/for-gci-students-where-to-start/using-the-issue-queue) to find a fix or solution for the problem. In case if you don't succeed in fixing the problem, revert the changes until you find a proper solution for your issue.
