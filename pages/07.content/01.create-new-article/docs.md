### Article Teaser

In the teaser section add **Teaser Image** and **Teaser Text**. The theme utilizes Drupal core **Media** module, which allows you to browse and reuse existing media that has been uploaded to your site.

Click on  the "**Select Image**" button and upload image, or click on the "**Select existing**" tab to use an existing image.

After choosing image for your teaser, you can click on the "**Edit**" button and use **Focal Point** to specify the portion of an image that is most important. For example, this will prevent  thumbnail that cuts off the subject's head. 

You will notice a **crosshair** in the middle of the image. Drag this crosshair to the most important part of your image. Alternatively you can click on the important part of your image if dragging seems too daunting.

#### Article Body

In this theme, the classic Body field is replaced with a **Paragraph Builder** as a new way of content creation. This will make things cleaner and will give you more editing power and flexibility. Instead of putting all the content in one WYSIWYG body field including images and videos, you can now choose on-the-fly between pre-defined Paragraph Types independent from one another.

To add new paragraph click on the "**Add paragraph**" button and from the pop-up choose which type of paragraph you wish to add.
