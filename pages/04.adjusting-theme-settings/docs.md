### Branding

The path required by the logo filed is relative to your Drupal root directory. The best location to place your logo is somewhere in your **current default theme** directory.

For example, you can replace the **logo-light.svg** and **logo-dark.svg** in the **branding** directory of the **em_magazine** theme, or you can create new structure, place your logo files and update the path to your logo in the theme settings.
