1. Download and unzip the [**Thunder**](https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder).
2. From Envato package unzip the **INSTALLATION/em-thunder.zip** and move **themes, modules, and libraries** to your Thunder root directory and **config** to your **sites/default** directory.
3. In the **sites/default** directory duplicate the **default.settings.php** file and rename it to **settings.php**.
4. Open the **settings.php** file with a text editor and add this line to the end of the file:

```php
$config_directories['sync'] = 'sites/default/config/sync';
```
    
5. Run Drush to install Thunder and EM from the configuration:

```sh
drush site:install thunder \
--existing-config \
--db-url=mysql://db_user:db_password@localhost/db_name  \
--account-name="demo" \
--account-pass="demo" \
--account-mail="your@email.com" \
thunder_module_configure_form.install_modules_thunder_demo=NULL
```

Change db_user, db_pass, and db_name with your database info. The --account-name is your Drupal username and the --account-pass your Drupal password. The last line "thunder_module_configure_form.install_modules_thunder_demo=NULL" tells the installer not to install Thunder demo content so you can install the EM Demo content later.


#### Install the demo content

To start with demo content, enable the **EM Thunder Demo** module:

```sh
drush en -y em_thunder_demo
```
