# Creating a View

The theme contains dozens of [teaser layouts](/views-and-teasers/available-teaser-layouts) and views examples. Using views you can organize and combine teasers with different layouts and create awesome content listings. The fastest and simplest way to create a new view is to make a [copy from an existing view example](/views-and-teasers/create-a-views-from-example), and adjust it by your needs.
