Managing the article layouts is almost the same as [managing page layout](/pages/managing-page-layouts). The only difference is that the changes you've made with the **IPE** (In-Place Editor) will only be applied to that article, instead on all articles that shares the same layout.

So if you want to make layout changes to a certain article, you can follow [managing page layout](/pages/managing-page-layouts) procedure. Otherwise, to make layout changes which will be appled to all articles that shares the same layout, do the following:

**Step 1**: Choose **Structure > Content Types** form the toolbar. (`/admin/structure/types`)

**Step 2**: Choose "**Manage display**" from operations dropdown menu. (`/admin/structure/types/manage/article/display`)
